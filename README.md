# XpertFlow-Skill-Trade-Platform

XpertFlow is a SKILL TRADE PLATFORM has been developed to facilitate skill-based
student collaboration within a university community. Instead of using cash, the site uses a
point-based system to let students register, make profiles, and trade talents. The currency for
starting and finishing transactions is a set of skill points that are allocated to each learner. Peerto-peer learning and project-based cooperation are promoted by allowing users to monitor,
filter, and reply to skill requests submitted by other students via a centralized dashboard.
The platform features a chat-based connection system where matched students can
communicate, share files, and coordinate their exchanges. To ensure fairness, a custom escrow
mechanism is implemented using skill points, where points are held during a trade and only
released upon successful completion by both parties. The system also includes safeguards—
penalizing users for dishonest behavior and revoking access if skill points fall below a set
threshold. An admin panel allows for monitoring user interactions and managing suspicious
activities, maintaining the platform’s integrity and trustworthiness
